# StudyingWorks website

The StudyingWorks website (hosted at <https://studyingworks.github.io/>).

## History
StudyingWorks, also known as the Entrepreneur Club, was a high school club founded in 2022 to provide educational videos and content for challenging AP classes.

Since its founding, the YouTube channel has put out over 30 videos, and the website offers practice problems.

However, since the members have since graduated, the club is no longer active and the website is no longer maintained. The site, and the code, stays up for archival purposes. Be warned that some content may be out of date.

## Codebase
This is a GitHub pages site written in vanilla HTML and JS.
